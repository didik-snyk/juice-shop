					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification) via the <code>extendedparser</code> and <code>urlencoded</code> functions when the URL encoding process is enabled. An attacker can flood the server with a large number of specially crafted requests.</p>

<h2>Remediation</h2>

<p>Upgrade <code>body-parser</code> to version 1.20.3 or higher.</p>

<h2>References</h2>

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/qs" rel="nofollow">qs</a> is a querystring parser that supports nesting and arrays, with a depth limit.</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Poisoning which allows attackers to cause a Node process to hang, processing an Array object whose prototype has been replaced by one with an excessive length value.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In many typical Express use cases, an unauthenticated remote attacker can place the attack payload in the query string of the URL that is used to visit the application, such as <code>a[__proto__]=b&amp;a[__proto__]&amp;a[length]=100000000</code>.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.</p>

<p>Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.</p>

<p>One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.</p>

<p>When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.</p>

<p>Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, <a href="SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082" rel="nofollow">commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108" rel="nofollow">npm <code>ws</code> package</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Remediation</h2>

<p>Upgrade <code>qs</code> to version 6.2.4, 6.3.3, 6.4.1, 6.5.3, 6.6.1, 6.7.3, 6.8.3, 6.9.7, 6.10.3 or higher.</p>

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mout" rel="nofollow">mout</a> is a Modular Utilities</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. The <code>deepFillIn</code> function can be used to ‘fill missing properties recursively’, while the <code>deepMixIn</code> mixes objects into the target object, recursively mixing existing child objects as well. In both cases, the key used to access the target object recursively is not checked, leading to exploiting this vulnerability.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>  This vulnerability derives from an incomplete fix of <a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-MOUT-1014544" rel="nofollow">CVE-2020-7792</a>.</p>

<h2>PoC</h2>

<pre><code>let mout = require(&#34;mout&#34;)
let b = {};
let payload = JSON.parse(&#39;[&#34;constructor.prototype.polluted&#34;]&#39;);
mout.object.set(b, payload, &#34;success&#34;);
console.log(polluted);
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Prototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as <code>__proto__</code>, <code>constructor</code> and <code>prototype</code>. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the <code>Object.prototype</code> are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.</p>

<p>There are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Unsafe <code>Object</code> recursive merge</p></li>

<li><p>Property definition by path</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Unsafe Object recursive merge</h3>

<p>The logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:</p>

<pre><code>merge (target, source)

  foreach property of source

    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source

      merge(target[property], source[property])

    else

      target[property] = source[property]
</code></pre>

<p><br></p>

<p>When the source object contains a property named <code>__proto__</code> defined with <code>Object.defineProperty()</code> , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of <code>Object</code> and the source of <code>Object</code> as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the <code>Object</code> prototype.</p>

<p>Clone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: <code>merge({},source)</code>.</p>

<p><code>lodash</code> and <code>Hoek</code> are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.</p>

<h3>Property definition by path</h3>

<p>There are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: <code>theFunction(object, path, value)</code></p>

<p>If the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to <code>__proto__.myValue</code>. <code>myValue</code> is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.</p>

<h2>Types of attacks</h2>

In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br><strong>For example:</strong> if an attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.toString</code> by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on <code>someobject.toString()</code> it would fail.</td>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.</p>

<p>Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.</p>

<p>One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.</p>

<p>When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.</p>

<p>Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, <a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082" rel="nofollow">commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108" rel="nofollow">npm <code>ws</code> package</a></p></li>

<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimist" rel="nofollow">minimist</a> is a parse argument options module.</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution due to a missing handler to <code>Function.prototype</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<li><p>This vulnerability is a bypass to <a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-MINIMIST-559764" rel="nofollow">CVE-2020-7598</a></p></li>

<li><p>The reason for the different CVSS between CVE-2021-44906 to CVE-2020-7598, is that CVE-2020-7598 can pollute objects, while CVE-2021-44906 can pollute only function.</p></li>

<h2>PoC by Snyk</h2>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Prototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as <code>__proto__</code>, <code>constructor</code> and <code>prototype</code>. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the <code>Object.prototype</code> are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.</p>

<p>There are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Unsafe <code>Object</code> recursive merge</p></li>

<li><p>Property definition by path</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Unsafe Object recursive merge</h3>

<p>The logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:</p>

<pre><code>merge (target, source)

  foreach property of source

    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source

      merge(target[property], source[property])

    else

      target[property] = source[property]
</code></pre>

<p><br></p>

<p>When the source object contains a property named <code>__proto__</code> defined with <code>Object.defineProperty()</code> , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of <code>Object</code> and the source of <code>Object</code> as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the <code>Object</code> prototype.</p>

<p>Clone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: <code>merge({},source)</code>.</p>

<p><code>lodash</code> and <code>Hoek</code> are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.</p>

<h3>Property definition by path</h3>

<p>There are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: <code>theFunction(object, path, value)</code></p>

<p>If the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to <code>__proto__.myValue</code>. <code>myValue</code> is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.</p>

<h2>Types of attacks</h2>

<p>There are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>

<p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren’t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>

<p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>

<pre><code>regex = /A(B|C+)+D/
</code></pre>

<p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:
- <code>A</code> The string must start with the letter ‘A’
- <code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter ‘B’ or some number of occurrences of the letter ‘C’ (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
- <code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a ’D’</p>

<p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>

<p>It most cases, it doesn’t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>

<pre><code>$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&#34;)&#39;
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&#34;)&#39;
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total
</code></pre>

<p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>

<p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: “ACCCX”. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C’s:
1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.</p>

<p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger" rel="nofollow">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn’t match.</p>

<p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>

<tr>
<th>String</th>

<td align="right">14</td>
<td align="right">65,553</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>By the time the string includes 14 C’s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via the <code>parse</code> method , which does not restrict parsing of keys named <code>__proto__</code>, allowing specially crafted strings to pollute the prototype of the resulting object.

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/dottie" rel="nofollow">dottie</a> is a Fast and safe nested object access and manipulation in JavaScript</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution due to insufficient checks, via the <code>set()</code> function and the <code>current</code> variable in the <code>/dottie.js</code> file.</p>

<h2>PoC</h2>

<pre><code>var dottie = require(&#34;dottie&#34;)


var obj1 = {}
var obj2 = {}

var bad_path1 = &#39;__proto__.test1&#39;
var bad_path2 = &#39;__proto__.test2&#39;
console.log(&#34;before:&#34;+ obj1.test1)
console.log(&#34;before:&#34;+ obj2.test2)
dottie.default(obj1,bad_path1,&#34;polluted1&#34;)
dottie.set(obj2,bad_path2,&#34;polluted2&#34;)
console.log(&#34;after:&#34;+obj1.test1)
console.log(&#34;after:&#34;+obj2.test2)
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Prototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as <code>__proto__</code>, <code>constructor</code> and <code>prototype</code>. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the <code>Object.prototype</code> are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.</p>

<p>There are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Unsafe <code>Object</code> recursive merge</p></li>

<li><p>Property definition by path</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Unsafe Object recursive merge</h3>

<p>The logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:</p>

<pre><code>merge (target, source)

  foreach property of source

    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source

      merge(target[property], source[property])

    else

      target[property] = source[property]
</code></pre>

<p><br></p>

<p>When the source object contains a property named <code>__proto__</code> defined with <code>Object.defineProperty()</code> , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of <code>Object</code> and the source of <code>Object</code> as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the <code>Object</code> prototype.</p>

<p>Clone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: <code>merge({},source)</code>.</p>

<p><code>lodash</code> and <code>Hoek</code> are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.</p>

<h3>Property definition by path</h3>

<p>There are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: <code>theFunction(object, path, value)</code></p>

<p>If the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to <code>__proto__.myValue</code>. <code>myValue</code> is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.</p>

<h2>Types of attacks</h2>

<p>There are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Origin</th>
<th>Short description</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Denial of service (DoS)</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
<td>This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when <code>Object</code> holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, <code>toString</code> and <code>valueOf</code>). <br> The attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.someattr</code> and alters its state to an unexpected value such as <code>Int</code> or <code>Object</code>. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br><strong>For example:</strong> if an attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.toString</code> by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on <code>someobject.toString()</code> it would fail.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td><strong>Remote Code Execution</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Property Injection</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
<td>The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.<br>  <strong>For example:</strong> if a codebase checks privileges for <code>someuser.isAdmin</code>, then when the attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.isAdmin</code> and sets it to equal <code>true</code>, they can then achieve admin privileges.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Affected environments</h2>

<p>The following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Application server</p></li>

<li><p>Web server</p></li>

<li><p>Web browser</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>How to prevent</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Freeze the prototype— use <code>Object.freeze (Object.prototype)</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>Require schema validation of JSON input.</p></li>

<li><p>Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.</p></li>

<li><p>Consider using objects without prototypes (for example, <code>Object.create(null)</code>), breaking the prototype chain and preventing pollution.</p></li>

<li><p>As a best practice use <code>Map</code> instead of <code>Object</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kevva/decompress-tar" rel="nofollow">decompress-tar</a> is a tar plugin for decompress.</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (Zip Slip). It is possible to bypass the security measures provided by decompress  and conduct ZIP path traversal through symlinks.</p>

<h3>PoC</h3>

<pre><code>const decompress = require(&#39;decompress&#39;);

decompress(&#39;slip.tar.gz&#39;, &#39;dist&#39;).then(files =&gt; {
	console.log(&#39;done!&#39;);
});
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>It is exploited using a specially crafted zip archive, that holds path traversal filenames. When exploited, a filename in a malicious archive is concatenated to the target extraction directory, which results in the final path ending up outside of the target folder. For instance, a zip may hold a file with a “../../file.exe” location and thus break out of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.</p>

<p>The following is an example of a zip archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicous file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in <code>/root/.ssh/</code> overwriting the <code>authorized_keys</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>
+2018-04-15 22:04:29 ..... 19 19 good.txt

+2018-04-15 22:04:42 ..... 20 20 ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). The issue can be exploited via malicious request header values sent to a server, when that server reads the cache policy from the request using this library.</p>

<h2>PoC</h2>

<p>Steps to reproduce:</p>

<p>Run the following script in Node.js after installing the <code>http-cache-semantics</code> NPM package:</p>

<pre><code>const CachePolicy = require(&#34;http-cache-semantics&#34;);

for (let i = 0; i &lt;= 5; i++) {

const attack = &#34;a&#34; + &#34; &#34;.repeat(i * 7000) +
&#34;z&#34;;

const start = performance.now();
new CachePolicy({
headers: {},
}, {
headers: {
&#34;cache-control&#34;: attack,
},


});
console.log(`${attack.length}: ${performance.now() - start}ms`);
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>

<p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren’t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>

<p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>

<pre><code>regex = /A(B|C+)+D/
</code></pre>

<p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:
- <code>A</code> The string must start with the letter ‘A’
- <code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter ‘B’ or some number of occurrences of the letter ‘C’ (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
- <code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a ’D’</p>

<p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>

<p>It most cases, it doesn’t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>

<pre><code>$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&#34;)&#39;
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&#34;)&#39;
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total
</code></pre>

<p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>

<p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: “ACCCX”. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C’s:
1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.</p>

<p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger" rel="nofollow">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn’t match.</p>

<p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>String</th>
<th align="right">Number of C’s</th>
<th align="right">Number of steps</th>

<tr>
<td>ACCCX</td>
<td align="right">3</td>

<td align="right">136</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX</td>
<td align="right">14</td>
<td align="right">65,553</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>By the time the string includes 14 C’s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) when including multiple regular expression parameters in a single segment, which will produce the regular expression <code>/^\/([^\/]+?)-([^\/]+?)\/?$/</code>, if two parameters within a single segment are separated by a character other than a <code>/</code> or <code>.</code>. Poor performance will block the event loop and can lead to a DoS.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>
While the 8.0.0 release has completely eliminated the vulnerable functionality, prior versions that have received the patch to mitigate backtracking may still be vulnerable if custom regular expressions are used. So it is strongly recommended for regular expression input to be controlled to avoid malicious performance degradation in those versions. This behavior is enforced as of version 7.1.0 via the <code>strict</code> option, which returns an error if a dangerous regular expression is detected.</p>

<h2>Workaround</h2>

<p>This vulnerability can be avoided by using a custom regular expression for parameters after the first in a segment, which excludes <code>-</code> and <code>/</code>.</p>

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/pillarjs/send" rel="nofollow">send</a> is a Better streaming static file server with Range and conditional-GET support</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting due to improper user input sanitization passed to the <code>SendStream.redirect()</code> function, which executes untrusted code. An attacker can execute arbitrary code by manipulating the input parameters to this method.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<p>Exploiting this vulnerability requires the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The attacker needs to control the input to <code>response.redirect()</code></p></li>

<li><p>Express MUST NOT redirect before the template appears</p></li>

<li><p>The browser MUST NOT complete redirection before</p></li>

<li><p>The user MUST click on the link in the template</p>

<h2>Details</h2></li>
</ol>

<p>A cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.</p>

<p>This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.</p>

<p>Injecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.</p>

<p>Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, <code>&lt;</code> can be coded as  <code>&amp;lt</code>; and <code>&gt;</code> can be coded as <code>&amp;gt</code>; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.</p>

<p>The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware.</p>

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/base64url" rel="nofollow">base64url</a> Converting to, and from, base64url.</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Uninitialized Memory Exposure. An attacker could extract sensitive data from uninitialized memory or may cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by passing in a large number, in setups where typed user input can be passed (e.g. from JSON).</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>The Buffer class on Node.js is a mutable array of binary data, and can be initialized with a string, array or number.</p>

<pre><code>const buf1 = new Buffer([1,2,3]);
// creates a buffer containing [01, 02, 03]
const buf2 = new Buffer(&#39;test&#39;);
// creates a buffer containing ASCII bytes [74, 65, 73, 74]
const buf3 = new Buffer(10);
// creates a buffer of length 10
</code></pre>

<p>The first two variants simply create a binary representation of the value it received. The last one, however, pre-allocates a buffer of the specified size, making it a useful buffer, especially when reading data from a stream.
When using the number constructor of Buffer, it will allocate the memory, but will not fill it with zeros. Instead, the allocated buffer will hold whatever was in memory at the time. If the buffer is not <code>zeroed</code> by using <code>buf.fill(0)</code>, it may leak sensitive information like keys, source code, and system info.</p>

<h2>Remediation</h2>

<p>Upgrade <code>base64url</code> to version 3.0.0 or higher.
<strong>Note</strong> This is vulnerable only for Node &lt;=4</p>

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment" rel="nofollow">moment</a> is a lightweight JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates.</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Directory Traversal when a user provides a locale string which is directly used to switch moment locale.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>A Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with “dot-dot-slash (../)” sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.</p>

<p>Directory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Information Disclosure</strong>: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>st</code> is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206" rel="nofollow">vulnerability of this type</a>. In our example, we will serve files from the <code>public</code> route.</p>

<p>If an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.</p>

<pre><code>curl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong> <code>%2e</code> is the URL encoded version of <code>.</code> (dot).</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Writing arbitrary files</strong>: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as <code>Zip-Slip</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>One way to achieve this is by using a malicious <code>zip</code> archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.</p>

<p>The following is an example of a <code>zip</code> archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in <code>/root/.ssh/</code> overwriting the <code>authorized_keys</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt
2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys
</code></pre>

					<h3>Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)</h3>
					
					<p>Severity: <span id="LOW">LOW</span></p>

					<p><a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/npm:moment:20170905">Reference Documentation</a></p>
					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment" rel="nofollow">moment</a> is a lightweight JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates.</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). It used a regular expression (<code>/[0-9]*[&#39;a-z\u00A0-\u05FF\u0700-\uD7FF\uF900-\uFDCF\uFDF0-\uFFEF]+|[\u0600-\u06FF\/]+(\s*?[\u0600-\u06FF]+){1,2}/i</code>) in order to parse dates specified as strings. This can cause a very low impact of about 2 seconds matching time for data 50k characters long.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>

<p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren’t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>

<p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>

<pre><code>regex = /A(B|C+)+D/
</code></pre>

<p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:
- <code>A</code> The string must start with the letter ‘A’
- <code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter ‘B’ or some number of occurrences of the letter ‘C’ (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
- <code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a ’D’</p>

<p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>

<p>It most cases, it doesn’t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>

<pre><code>$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&#34;)&#39;
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&#34;)&#39;
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total
</code></pre>

<p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>

<p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: “ACCCX”. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C’s:
1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.</p>

<p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger" rel="nofollow">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn’t match.</p>

<p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>String</th>
<th align="right">Number of C’s</th>
<th align="right">Number of steps</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ACCCX</td>
<td align="right">3</td>
<td align="right">38</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCX</td>
<td align="right">4</td>
<td align="right">71</td>

<td align="right">136</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX</td>
<td align="right">14</td>
<td align="right">65,553</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>By the time the string includes 14 C’s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: “ACCCX”. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C’s:
1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.</p>

<p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger" rel="nofollow">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn’t match.</p>

<p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment" rel="nofollow"><code>moment</code></a> is a lightweight JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates.</p>

<p>An attacker can provide a long value to the <code>duration</code> function, which nearly matches the pattern being matched. This will cause the regular expression matching to take a long time, all the while occupying the event loop and preventing it from processing other requests and making the server unavailable (a Denial of Service attack).</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>

<p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren’t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>

<p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>

<pre><code>regex = /A(B|C+)+D/
</code></pre>

<p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:
- <code>A</code> The string must start with the letter ‘A’
- <code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter ‘B’ or some number of occurrences of the letter ‘C’ (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
- <code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a ’D’</p>

<p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>

<p>It most cases, it doesn’t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>

<pre><code>$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&#34;)&#39;
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&#34;)&#39;
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total
</code></pre>

<p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>

<p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>

					<h3>Directory Traversal</h3>
					
					<p>Severity: <span id="HIGH">HIGH</span></p>

					<p><a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-MOMENT-2440688">Reference Documentation</a></p>
					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment" rel="nofollow">moment</a> is a lightweight JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates.</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Directory Traversal when a user provides a locale string which is directly used to switch moment locale.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>A Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with “dot-dot-slash (../)” sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.</p>

<p>Directory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Information Disclosure</strong>: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>st</code> is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206" rel="nofollow">vulnerability of this type</a>. In our example, we will serve files from the <code>public</code> route.</p>

<p>If an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.</p>

<pre><code>curl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong> <code>%2e</code> is the URL encoded version of <code>.</code> (dot).</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Writing arbitrary files</strong>: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as <code>Zip-Slip</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>One way to achieve this is by using a malicious <code>zip</code> archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.</p>

<p>The following is an example of a <code>zip</code> archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in <code>/root/.ssh/</code> overwriting the <code>authorized_keys</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt
2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys
</code></pre>

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime via the <code>makeres</code> function due to improperly deleting keys from the <code>reqs</code> object after execution of callbacks. This behavior causes the keys to remain in the <code>reqs</code> object, which leads to resource exhaustion.</p>

<p>Exploiting this vulnerability results in crashing the <code>node</code> process or in the application crash.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>
This library is not maintained, and currently, there is no fix for this issue. To overcome this vulnerability, several dependent packages have eliminated the use of this library.</p>

<p>To trigger the memory leak, an attacker would need to have the ability to execute or influence the asynchronous operations that use the inflight module within the application. This typically requires access to the internal workings of the server or application, which is not commonly exposed to remote users. Therefore, “Attack vector” is marked as “Local”.</p>

<h2>PoC</h2>

<pre><code>const inflight = require(&#39;inflight&#39;);

function testInflight() {
  let i = 0;
  function scheduleNext() {
    let key = `key-${i++}`;

<p>Let’s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: “ACCCX”. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C’s:
1. CCC
2. CC+C

<p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>

<p>A Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with “dot-dot-slash (../)” sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.</p>

<p>Directory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Information Disclosure</strong>: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>st</code> is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206" rel="nofollow">vulnerability of this type</a>. In our example, we will serve files from the <code>public</code> route.</p>

<p>If an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.</p>

<pre><code>curl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong> <code>%2e</code> is the URL encoded version of <code>.</code> (dot).</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Writing arbitrary files</strong>: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as <code>Zip-Slip</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>One way to achieve this is by using a malicious <code>zip</code> archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.</p>

<p>The following is an example of a <code>zip</code> archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in <code>/root/.ssh/</code> overwriting the <code>authorized_keys</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt
2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys
</code></pre>

					<h3>Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)</h3>
					
					<p>Severity: <span id="HIGH">HIGH</span></p>
					
					<p><a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/npm:underscore.string:20170908">Reference Documentation</a></p>
					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/underscore.string" rel="nofollow">underscore.string</a> is a Javascript lacks complete string manipulation operations.</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). It parses dates using regex strings, which may cause a slowdown of 2 seconds per 50k characters.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>

<p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren’t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>

<p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>

<pre><code>regex = /A(B|C+)+D/
</code></pre>

<p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:
- <code>A</code> The string must start with the letter ‘A’
- <code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter ‘B’ or some number of occurrences of the letter ‘C’ (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
- <code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a ’D’</p>

<p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>

<p>It most cases, it doesn’t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>

<pre><code>$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&#34;)&#39;
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&#34;)&#39;
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total
</code></pre>

<p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>

<p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: “ACCCX”. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C’s:
1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.</p>

<p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger" rel="nofollow">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn’t match.</p>

<p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>String</th>
<th align="right">Number of C’s</th>
<th align="right">Number of steps</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ACCCX</td>
<td align="right">3</td>
<td align="right">38</td>

<tr>

<td align="right">136</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX</td>
<td align="right">14</td>
<td align="right">65,553</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>By the time the string includes 14 C’s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

					<p><a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-ASYNC-2441827">Reference Documentation</a></p>
					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via the <code>mapValues()</code> method, due to improper check in <code>createObjectIterator</code> function.</p>

<h2>PoC</h2>

<pre><code>//when objects are parsed, all properties are created as own (the objects can come from outside sources (http requests/ file))
const hasOwn = JSON.parse(&#39;{&#34;__proto__&#34;: {&#34;isAdmin&#34;: true}}&#39;);

//does not have the property,  because it&#39;s inside object&#39;s own &#34;__proto__&#34;
console.log(hasOwn.isAdmin);

async.mapValues(hasOwn, (val, key, cb) =&gt; cb(null, val), (error, result) =&gt; {
  // after the method executes, hasOwn.__proto__ value (isAdmin: true) replaces the prototype of the newly created object, leading to potential exploits.
  console.log(result.isAdmin);
});
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Prototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as <code>__proto__</code>, <code>constructor</code> and <code>prototype</code>. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the <code>Object.prototype</code> are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.</p>

<p>There are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Unsafe <code>Object</code> recursive merge</p></li>

<li><p>Property definition by path</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Unsafe Object recursive merge</h3>

<p>The logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:</p>

<pre><code>merge (target, source)

  foreach property of source

    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source

      merge(target[property], source[property])

    else

      target[property] = source[property]
</code></pre>

<p><br></p>

<p>When the source object contains a property named <code>__proto__</code> defined with <code>Object.defineProperty()</code> , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of <code>Object</code> and the source of <code>Object</code> as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the <code>Object</code> prototype.</p>

<p>Clone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: <code>merge({},source)</code>.</p>

<p><code>lodash</code> and <code>Hoek</code> are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.</p>

<h3>Property definition by path</h3>

<p>There are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: <code>theFunction(object, path, value)</code></p>

<p>If the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to <code>__proto__.myValue</code>. <code>myValue</code> is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.</p>

<h2>Types of attacks</h2>

<p>There are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Origin</th>
<th>Short description</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Denial of service (DoS)</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
<td>This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when <code>Object</code> holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, <code>toString</code> and <code>valueOf</code>). <br> The attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.someattr</code> and alters its state to an unexpected value such as <code>Int</code> or <code>Object</code>. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br><strong>For example:</strong> if an attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.toString</code> by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on <code>someobject.toString()</code> it would fail.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td><strong>Remote Code Execution</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Property Injection</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
<td>The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.<br>  <strong>For example:</strong> if a codebase checks privileges for <code>someuser.isAdmin</code>, then when the attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.isAdmin</code> and sets it to equal <code>true</code>, they can then achieve admin privileges.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Affected environments</h2>

<p>The following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Application server</p></li>

<li><p>Web server</p></li>

<li><p>Web browser</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>How to prevent</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Freeze the prototype— use <code>Object.freeze (Object.prototype)</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>Require schema validation of JSON input.</p></li>

<li><p>Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.</p></li>

<li><p>Consider using objects without prototypes (for example, <code>Object.create(null)</code>), breaking the prototype chain and preventing pollution.</p></li>

<li><p>As a best practice use <code>Map</code> instead of <code>Object</code>.</p></li>

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to the sub-patterns<code>[[\\]()#;?]*</code> and <code>(?:;[-a-zA-Z\\d\\/#&amp;.:=?%@~_]*)*</code>.</p>

<h3>PoC</h3>

<pre><code>import ansiRegex from &#39;ansi-regex&#39;;

}
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>

<p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren’t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>

<p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>

<pre><code>regex = /A(B|C+)+D/
</code></pre>

<p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:
- <code>A</code> The string must start with the letter ‘A’
- <code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter ‘B’ or some number of occurrences of the letter ‘C’ (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
- <code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a ’D’</p>

<p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>

<p>It most cases, it doesn’t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>

<pre><code>$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&#34;)&#39;
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&#34;)&#39;
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total
</code></pre>

<p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>

<p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: “ACCCX”. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C’s:
1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.</p>

<p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger" rel="nofollow">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn’t match.</p>

<p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>String</th>
<th align="right">Number of C’s</th>
<th align="right">Number of steps</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ACCCX</td>
<td align="right">3</td>
<td align="right">38</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCX</td>
<td align="right">4</td>
<td align="right">71</td>
</tr>

<tr>

<td align="right">5</td>
<td align="right">136</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX</td>
<td align="right">14</td>
<td align="right">65,553</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>By the time the string includes 14 C’s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

					<h3>Prototype Pollution</h3>
					
					<p>Severity: <span id="HIGH">HIGH</span></p>
					
					<p><a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-LODASHSET-1320032">Reference Documentation</a></p>
					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash.set" rel="nofollow">lodash.set</a> is a lodash method _.set exported as a Node.js module.</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via the <code>set</code> and <code>setwith</code> functions due to improper user input sanitization.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong></p>

<p><code>lodash.set</code> is not maintained for a long time. It is recommended to use <code>lodash</code> library, which contains the fix since version 4.17.17.</p>

<h2>PoC</h2>

<pre><code>lod = require(&#39;lodash&#39;)
lod.set({}, &#34;__proto__[test2]&#34;, &#34;456&#34;)
console.log(Object.prototype)
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Prototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as <code>__proto__</code>, <code>constructor</code> and <code>prototype</code>. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the <code>Object.prototype</code> are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.</p>

<p>There are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Unsafe <code>Object</code> recursive merge</p></li>

<li><p>Property definition by path</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Unsafe Object recursive merge</h3>

<p>The logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:</p>

<pre><code>merge (target, source)

  foreach property of source

    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source

      merge(target[property], source[property])

    else

      target[property] = source[property]
</code></pre>

<p><br></p>

<p>When the source object contains a property named <code>__proto__</code> defined with <code>Object.defineProperty()</code> , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of <code>Object</code> and the source of <code>Object</code> as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the <code>Object</code> prototype.</p>

<p>Clone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: <code>merge({},source)</code>.</p>

<p><code>lodash</code> and <code>Hoek</code> are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.</p>

<h3>Property definition by path</h3>

<p>There are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: <code>theFunction(object, path, value)</code></p>

<p>If the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to <code>__proto__.myValue</code>. <code>myValue</code> is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.</p>

<h2>Types of attacks</h2>

<p>There are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Origin</th>
<th>Short description</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Denial of service (DoS)</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
<td>This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when <code>Object</code> holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, <code>toString</code> and <code>valueOf</code>). <br> The attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.someattr</code> and alters its state to an unexpected value such as <code>Int</code> or <code>Object</code>. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br><strong>For example:</strong> if an attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.toString</code> by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on <code>someobject.toString()</code> it would fail.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td><strong>Remote Code Execution</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Property Injection</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
<td>The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.<br>  <strong>For example:</strong> if a codebase checks privileges for <code>someuser.isAdmin</code>, then when the attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.isAdmin</code> and sets it to equal <code>true</code>, they can then achieve admin privileges.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Affected environments</h2>

<p>The following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Application server</p></li>

<li><p>Web server</p></li>

<li><p>Web browser</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>How to prevent</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Freeze the prototype— use <code>Object.freeze (Object.prototype)</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>Require schema validation of JSON input.</p></li>

<li><p>Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.</p></li>

<li><p>Consider using objects without prototypes (for example, <code>Object.create(null)</code>), breaking the prototype chain and preventing pollution.</p></li>

<li><p>As a best practice use <code>Map</code> instead of <code>Object</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<thead>
<tr>
<th>String</th>
<th align="right">Number of C’s</th>
<th align="right">Number of steps</th>

<tbody>
<tr>

<p>By the time the string includes 14 C’s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2#readme" rel="nofollow">vm2</a> is a sandbox that can run untrusted code with whitelisted Node’s built-in modules.</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Sandbox Escape. There exists a vulnerability in source code transformer (exception sanitization logic), allowing attackers to bypass <code>handleException()</code> and leak unsanitized host exceptions which can be used to escape the sandbox and run arbitrary code in host context.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.</p>

<p>Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.</p>

<p>One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.</p>

<p>When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.</p>

<p>Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, <a href="SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082" rel="nofollow">commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108" rel="nofollow">npm <code>ws</code> package</a></p></li>
</ul>

<pre><code>const {VM} = require(&#34;vm2&#34;);
let vmInstance = new VM();

let code = `    
    res = eval(&#39;import(\\&#39;./foo.js\\&#39;);&#39;)    
    res.__proto__.__proto__.polluted = res.__proto__.__proto__.toString.constructor(&#34;return this&#34;)().process.mainModule.require(&#34;child_process&#34;).execSync(&#34;touch HACKED&#34;).toString();
`;
vmInstance.run(code);
console.log(polluted);
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Prototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as <code>__proto__</code>, <code>constructor</code> and <code>prototype</code>. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the <code>Object.prototype</code> are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.</p>

<p>There are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Unsafe <code>Object</code> recursive merge</p></li>

<li><p>Property definition by path</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Unsafe Object recursive merge</h3>

<p>The logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:</p>

<pre><code>merge (target, source)

  foreach property of source

    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source

      merge(target[property], source[property])

    else

      target[property] = source[property]
</code></pre>

<p><br></p>

<p>When the source object contains a property named <code>__proto__</code> defined with <code>Object.defineProperty()</code> , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of <code>Object</code> and the source of <code>Object</code> as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the <code>Object</code> prototype.</p>

<p>Clone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: <code>merge({},source)</code>.</p>

<p><code>lodash</code> and <code>Hoek</code> are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.</p>

<h3>Property definition by path</h3>

<p>There are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: <code>theFunction(object, path, value)</code></p>

<p>If the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to <code>__proto__.myValue</code>. <code>myValue</code> is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.</p>

<h2>Types of attacks</h2>

<p>There are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Origin</th>
<th>Short description</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Denial of service (DoS)</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
<td>This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when <code>Object</code> holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, <code>toString</code> and <code>valueOf</code>). <br> The attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.someattr</code> and alters its state to an unexpected value such as <code>Int</code> or <code>Object</code>. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br><strong>For example:</strong> if an attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.toString</code> by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on <code>someobject.toString()</code> it would fail.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td><strong>Remote Code Execution</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Property Injection</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
<td>The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.<br>  <strong>For example:</strong> if a codebase checks privileges for <code>someuser.isAdmin</code>, then when the attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.isAdmin</code> and sets it to equal <code>true</code>, they can then achieve admin privileges.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Affected environments</h2>

<p>The following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Application server</p></li>

<li><p>Web server</p></li>

<li><p>Web browser</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>How to prevent</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Freeze the prototype— use <code>Object.freeze (Object.prototype)</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>Require schema validation of JSON input.</p></li>

<li><p>Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.</p></li>

<li><p>Consider using objects without prototypes (for example, <code>Object.create(null)</code>), breaking the prototype chain and preventing pollution.</p></li>

<li><p>As a best practice use <code>Map</code> instead of <code>Object</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the function <code>new Range</code>, when untrusted user data is provided as a range.</p>

<h2>PoC</h2>

</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>

<p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren’t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>

<p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>

<pre><code>regex = /A(B|C+)+D/
</code></pre>

<p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:
- <code>A</code> The string must start with the letter ‘A’
- <code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter ‘B’ or some number of occurrences of the letter ‘C’ (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
- <code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a ’D’</p>

<p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>

<p>It most cases, it doesn’t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>

<pre><code>$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&#34;)&#39;
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&#34;)&#39;
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total
</code></pre>

<p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>

<p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: “ACCCX”. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C’s:
1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.</p>

<p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger" rel="nofollow">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn’t match.</p>

<p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>String</th>
<th align="right">Number of C’s</th>
<th align="right">Number of steps</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ACCCX</td>
<td align="right">3</td>
<td align="right">38</td>

<td align="right">136</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX</td>
<td align="right">14</td>
<td align="right">65,553</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>By the time the string includes 14 C’s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/tar" rel="nofollow">tar</a> is a full-featured Tar for Node.js.</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (‘Resource Exhaustion’) due to the lack of folders count validation during the folder creation process. An attacker who generates a large number of sub-folders can consume memory on the system running the software and even crash the client within few seconds of running it using a path with too many sub-folders inside.</p>

<h2>Remediation</h2>

<p>Upgrade <code>tar</code> to version 6.2.1 or higher.</p>

</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Prototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as <code>__proto__</code>, <code>constructor</code> and <code>prototype</code>. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the <code>Object.prototype</code> are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.</p>

<p>There are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Unsafe <code>Object</code> recursive merge</p></li>

<li><p>Property definition by path</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Unsafe Object recursive merge</h3>

<p>The logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:</p>

<pre><code>merge (target, source)

  foreach property of source

    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source

      merge(target[property], source[property])

    else

      target[property] = source[property]
</code></pre>

<p><br></p>

<p>When the source object contains a property named <code>__proto__</code> defined with <code>Object.defineProperty()</code> , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of <code>Object</code> and the source of <code>Object</code> as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the <code>Object</code> prototype.</p>

<p>Clone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: <code>merge({},source)</code>.</p>

<p><code>lodash</code> and <code>Hoek</code> are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.</p>

<h3>Property definition by path</h3>

<p>There are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: <code>theFunction(object, path, value)</code></p>

<p>If the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to <code>__proto__.myValue</code>. <code>myValue</code> is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.</p>

<h2>Types of attacks</h2>

<p>There are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Denial of service (DoS)</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
<td>This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when <code>Object</code> holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, <code>toString</code> and <code>valueOf</code>). <br> The attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.someattr</code> and alters its state to an unexpected value such as <code>Int</code> or <code>Object</code>. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br><strong>For example:</strong> if an attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.toString</code> by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on <code>someobject.toString()</code> it would fail.</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Property Injection</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
<td>The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.<br>  <strong>For example:</strong> if a codebase checks privileges for <code>someuser.isAdmin</code>, then when the attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.isAdmin</code> and sets it to equal <code>true</code>, they can then achieve admin privileges.</td>
</tr>

<h2>Affected environments</h2>

<p>The following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Application server</p></li>

<li><p>Web server</p></li>

<li><p>Web browser</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>How to prevent</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Freeze the prototype— use <code>Object.freeze (Object.prototype)</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>Require schema validation of JSON input.</p></li>

<li><p>Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.</p></li>

<li><p>Consider using objects without prototypes (for example, <code>Object.create(null)</code>), breaking the prototype chain and preventing pollution.</p></li>

<li><p>As a best practice use <code>Map</code> instead of <code>Object</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/brix/crypto-js" rel="nofollow">crypto-js</a> is a library of crypto standards.</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Use of Weak Hash due to inadequate security settings in the <code>PBKDF2</code> configuration, which uses insecure SHA1 and has a low iteration count of 1. These insecure settings allow attackers to perform brute-force attacks when <code>PBKDF2</code> is used with the default parameters.</p>

<p>No information is directly exposed when a hash is generated, regardless of whether the PBKDF2 function is in the vulnerable configuration or not. However, it may be possible to recover the original data, more or less easily depending on the configured parameters, using a brute force attack. This is a low impact on the confidentiality of the protected data, which are in a different scope than the vulnerable package.</p>

<p>The attacker similarly may be able to modify some data which is meant to be protected by the vulnerable package - most commonly when it is used for signature verification. This would require a subsequent exploitation, such as forcing a hash collision via length extension attack. The integrity of the data is therefore compromised, but the quantity and targeting of that data is not fully in the attacker’s control, yielding a low integrity impact.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>This vulnerability is related to <a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-CRYPTOES-6032390" rel="nofollow">https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-CRYPTOES-6032390</a> in crypto-es.</p></li>

<li><p>According to the <code>crypto-js</code> maintainer:
“Active development of CryptoJS has been discontinued. This library is no longer maintained.”
It is recommended to use the Node.js native <code>crypto</code> module.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Workaround</h2>

<p>This vulnerability can be avoided by setting <code>PBKDF2</code> to use SHA-256 instead of SHA-1 and increasing the number of iterations to a sufficiently high value depending on the intended use.

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) when processing a malicious function name with the <code>copy()</code> function.</p>

<h2>PoC</h2>

<pre><code>const copy = require(&#39;es5-ext/function/#/copy&#39;);
var payload = function CRASHCRASHCRASHCRASHCRASHCRASHCRASHCRASHCRASHCRASHCRASHCRASHCRASH(consoleLog = () =&gt; console.log(&#34;bu&#34;)) {consoleLog();}
var copiedFunction = copy.call(payload);
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>

<p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren’t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>

<p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>

<pre><code>regex = /A(B|C+)+D/
</code></pre>

<p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:
- <code>A</code> The string must start with the letter ‘A’
- <code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter ‘B’ or some number of occurrences of the letter ‘C’ (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
- <code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a ’D’</p>

<p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>

<p>It most cases, it doesn’t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>

<pre><code>$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&#34;)&#39;
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&#34;)&#39;
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total
</code></pre>

<p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>

<p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: “ACCCX”. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C’s:
1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.</p>

<p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger" rel="nofollow">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn’t match.</p>

<p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>String</th>
<th align="right">Number of C’s</th>
<th align="right">Number of steps</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ACCCX</td>
<td align="right">3</td>
<td align="right">38</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCX</td>
<td align="right">4</td>
<td align="right">71</td>

<tr>

<td align="right">5</td>
<td align="right">136</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX</td>
<td align="right">14</td>
<td align="right">65,553</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>By the time the string includes 14 C’s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

					<h3>Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)</h3>

						<p>EPSS: <span>47%</span></p>
					
					<p><a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SANITIZEHTML-2957526">Reference Documentation</a></p>
					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/punkave/sanitize-html" rel="nofollow">sanitize-html</a> is a library that allows you to clean up user-submitted HTML, preserving whitelisted elements and whitelisted attributes on a per-element basis</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to insecure global regular expression replacement logic of HTML comment removal.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>

<p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren’t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>

<p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>

<pre><code>regex = /A(B|C+)+D/
</code></pre>

<p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:
- <code>A</code> The string must start with the letter ‘A’
- <code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter ‘B’ or some number of occurrences of the letter ‘C’ (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
- <code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a ’D’</p>

<p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>

<p>It most cases, it doesn’t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>

<pre><code>$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&#34;)&#39;
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&#34;)&#39;
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total
</code></pre>

<p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>

<p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: “ACCCX”. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C’s:
1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.</p>

<p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger" rel="nofollow">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn’t match.</p>

<p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>String</th>
<th align="right">Number of C’s</th>
<th align="right">Number of steps</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ACCCX</td>
<td align="right">3</td>
<td align="right">38</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCX</td>
<td align="right">4</td>
<td align="right">71</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCCX</td>
<td align="right">5</td>
<td align="right">136</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX</td>
<td align="right">14</td>
<td align="right">65,553</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>By the time the string includes 14 C’s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Validation Bypass.

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>A cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.</p>

<p>This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.</p>

<p>Injecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.</p>

<p>Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, <code>&lt;</code> can be coded as  <code>&amp;lt</code>; and <code>&gt;</code> can be coded as <code>&amp;gt</code>; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.</p>

<p>The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware.</p>

<p>Since the sanitize-html module trusts ‘text’ coming from htmlparser2, and outputs it without further escaping (because htmlparser2 does not decode entities in text before delivering it), this results in an XSS attack vector if sanitize-html ignores the img tag (according to user-configured filter rules) but passes the text intact, as it must do to keep any text in documents.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Prototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as <code>__proto__</code>, <code>constructor</code> and <code>prototype</code>. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the <code>Object.prototype</code> are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.</p>

<p>There are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Unsafe <code>Object</code> recursive merge</p></li>

<li><p>Property definition by path</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Unsafe Object recursive merge</h3>

<p>The logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:</p>

<pre><code>merge (target, source)

  foreach property of source

    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source

      merge(target[property], source[property])

    else

      target[property] = source[property]
</code></pre>

<p><br></p>

<p>When the source object contains a property named <code>__proto__</code> defined with <code>Object.defineProperty()</code> , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of <code>Object</code> and the source of <code>Object</code> as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the <code>Object</code> prototype.</p>

<p>Clone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: <code>merge({},source)</code>.</p>

<p><code>lodash</code> and <code>Hoek</code> are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.</p>

<h3>Property definition by path</h3>

<p>There are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: <code>theFunction(object, path, value)</code></p>

<p>If the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to <code>__proto__.myValue</code>. <code>myValue</code> is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>

<p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren’t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>

<p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>

<pre><code>regex = /A(B|C+)+D/
</code></pre>

<p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:
- <code>A</code> The string must start with the letter ‘A’
- <code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter ‘B’ or some number of occurrences of the letter ‘C’ (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
- <code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a ’D’</p>

<p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>

<p>It most cases, it doesn’t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>

<pre><code>$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&#34;)&#39;
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&#34;)&#39;
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total
</code></pre>

<p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>

<p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: “ACCCX”. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C’s:
1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.</p>

<p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger" rel="nofollow">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn’t match.</p>

<p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>String</th>
<th align="right">Number of C’s</th>
<th align="right">Number of steps</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ACCCX</td>
<td align="right">3</td>
<td align="right">38</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCX</td>
<td align="right">4</td>
<td align="right">71</td>

<tr>

<td align="right">136</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX</td>
<td align="right">14</td>
<td align="right">65,553</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>By the time the string includes 14 C’s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash" rel="nofollow">lodash</a> is a modern JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance, &amp; extras.</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). It parses dates using regex strings, which may cause a slowdown of 2 seconds per 50k characters.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>

<p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren’t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>

<p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>

<pre><code>regex = /A(B|C+)+D/
</code></pre>

<p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:
- <code>A</code> The string must start with the letter ‘A’
- <code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter ‘B’ or some number of occurrences of the letter ‘C’ (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
- <code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a ’D’</p>

<p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>

<p>It most cases, it doesn’t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>

<pre><code>$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&#34;)&#39;
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&#34;)&#39;
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total
</code></pre>

<p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>

<p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: “ACCCX”. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C’s:
1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.</p>

<p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger" rel="nofollow">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn’t match.</p>

<p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>String</th>
<th align="right">Number of C’s</th>
<th align="right">Number of steps</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ACCCX</td>
<td align="right">3</td>
<td align="right">38</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCX</td>
<td align="right">4</td>
<td align="right">71</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCCX</td>
<td align="right">5</td>
<td align="right">136</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX</td>
<td align="right">14</td>
<td align="right">65,553</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>By the time the string includes 14 C’s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

					<h3>Prototype Pollution</h3>
					
					<p>Severity: <span id="HIGH">HIGH</span></p>

					<p><a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-LODASH-73638">Reference Documentation</a></p>
					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash" rel="nofollow">lodash</a> is a modern JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance, &amp; extras.</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. The functions <code>merge</code>, <code>mergeWith</code>, and <code>defaultsDeep</code> could be tricked into adding or modifying properties of <code>Object.prototype</code>. This is due to an incomplete fix to <code>CVE-2018-3721</code>.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Prototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as <code>__proto__</code>, <code>constructor</code> and <code>prototype</code>. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the <code>Object.prototype</code> are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.</p>

<p>There are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Unsafe <code>Object</code> recursive merge</p></li>

<li><p>Property definition by path</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Unsafe Object recursive merge</h3>

<p>The logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:</p>

<pre><code>merge (target, source)

  foreach property of source

    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source

      merge(target[property], source[property])

    else

      target[property] = source[property]
</code></pre>

<p><br></p>

<p>When the source object contains a property named <code>__proto__</code> defined with <code>Object.defineProperty()</code> , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of <code>Object</code> and the source of <code>Object</code> as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the <code>Object</code> prototype.</p>

<p>Clone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: <code>merge({},source)</code>.</p>

<p><code>lodash</code> and <code>Hoek</code> are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.</p>

<h3>Property definition by path</h3>

<p>There are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: <code>theFunction(object, path, value)</code></p>

<p>If the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to <code>__proto__.myValue</code>. <code>myValue</code> is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.</p>

<h2>Types of attacks</h2>

<p>There are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:</p>

In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br><strong>For example:</strong> if an attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.toString</code> by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on <code>someobject.toString()</code> it would fail.</td>

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/socketio/socket.io" rel="nofollow">socket.io</a> is a node.js realtime framework server.</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Uncaught Exception in handling error events. If there is no listener set up for such events, an attacker can send packets containing them to crash the Node process.</p>

<h2>Workaround</h2>

<p>This vulnerability can be avoided by attaching a listener for error events, such as</p>

<pre><code>io.on(&#34;connection&#34;, (socket) =&gt; {
  socket.on(&#34;error&#34;, () =&gt; {
    // ...

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/debug" rel="nofollow">debug</a> is a small debugging utility.</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the function <code>useColors</code> via manipulation of the <code>str</code> argument.
The vulnerability can cause a very low impact of about 2 seconds of matching time for data 50k characters long.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>
CVE-2017-20165 is a duplicate of this vulnerability.</p>

<h2>PoC</h2>

<p>Use the following regex in the <code>%o</code> formatter.</p>

<pre><code>/\s*\n\s*/
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>

<p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren’t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>

<p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>

<pre><code>regex = /A(B|C+)+D/
</code></pre>

<p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:
- <code>A</code> The string must start with the letter ‘A’
- <code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter ‘B’ or some number of occurrences of the letter ‘C’ (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
- <code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a ’D’</p>

<p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>

<p>It most cases, it doesn’t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>

<pre><code>$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&#34;)&#39;
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&#34;)&#39;
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total
</code></pre>

<p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>

<p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: “ACCCX”. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C’s:
1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.</p>

<p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger" rel="nofollow">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn’t match.</p>

<p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>String</th>
<th align="right">Number of C’s</th>
<th align="right">Number of steps</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ACCCX</td>
<td align="right">3</td>
<td align="right">38</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCX</td>
<td align="right">4</td>
<td align="right">71</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCCX</td>
<td align="right">5</td>
<td align="right">136</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX</td>
<td align="right">14</td>
<td align="right">65,553</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>By the time the string includes 14 C’s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.</p>

<p>Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.</p>

<p>One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.</p>

<p>When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.</p>

<p>Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, <a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082" rel="nofollow">commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108" rel="nofollow">npm <code>ws</code> package</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>

<p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren’t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>

<p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>

<pre><code>regex = /A(B|C+)+D/
</code></pre>

<p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:
- <code>A</code> The string must start with the letter ‘A’
- <code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter ‘B’ or some number of occurrences of the letter ‘C’ (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
- <code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a ’D’</p>

<p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>

<p>It most cases, it doesn’t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>

<pre><code>$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&#34;)&#39;
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&#34;)&#39;
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total
</code></pre>

<p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>

<p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: “ACCCX”. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C’s:
1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.</p>

<p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger" rel="nofollow">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn’t match.</p>

<p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>String</th>
<th align="right">Number of C’s</th>
<th align="right">Number of steps</th>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>By the time the string includes 14 C’s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/tar" rel="nofollow">tar</a> is a full-featured Tar for Node.js.</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write. <code>node-tar</code> aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created.</p>

<p>This logic was insufficient when extracting <code>tar</code> files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both <code>\</code> and <code>/</code> characters as path separators. However, <code>\</code> is a valid filename character on posix systems.</p>

<p>By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it is possible to bypass <code>node-tar</code> symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted <code>tar</code> file to symlink into an arbitrary location. This can lead to extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.</p>

<p>Additionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive filesystems. If a <code>tar</code> archive contained a directory at <code>FOO</code>, followed by a symbolic link named <code>foo</code>, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but not from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit. A subsequent file entry within the <code>FOO</code> directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic link, thinking that the directory had already been created.</p>

<p>This logic is insufficient when extracting <code>tar</code> files that contain two directories and a symlink with names containing unicode values that normalized to the same value. Additionally, on Windows systems, long path portions would resolve to the same file system entities as their 8.3 “short path” counterparts.
A specially crafted <code>tar</code> archive can include directories with two forms of the path that resolve to the same file system entity, followed by a symbolic link with a name in the first form, lastly followed by a file using the second form. This leads to bypassing <code>node-tar</code> symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted <code>tar</code> file to symlink into an arbitrary location and extracting arbitrary files into that location.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/tar" rel="nofollow">tar</a> is a full-featured Tar for Node.js.</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write. <code>node-tar</code> aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be outside of the extraction target directory is not extracted. This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain <code>..</code> path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory.</p>

<p>This logic is insufficient on Windows systems when extracting <code>tar</code> files that contain a path that is not an absolute path, but specify a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as <code>C:some\path</code>. If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example <code>D:\extraction\dir</code>, then the result of <code>path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)</code> resolves against the current working directory on the <code>C:</code> drive, rather than the extraction target directory.</p>

<p>Additionally, a <code>..</code> portion of the path can occur immediately after the drive letter, such as <code>C:../foo</code>, and is not properly sanitized by the logic that checks for <code>..</code> within the normalized and split portions of the path.</p>

<p><code>node-tar</code> aims to prevent extraction of absolute file paths by turning absolute paths into relative paths when the <code>preservePaths</code> flag is not set to <code>true</code>. This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example, the path <code>/home/user/.bashrc</code> would turn into <code>home/user/.bashrc</code>.</p>

<p>This logic is insufficient when file paths contain repeated path roots such as <code>////home/user/.bashrc</code>. <code>node-tar</code> only strips a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. <code>///home/user/.bashrc</code>) still resolves to an absolute path.</p>

<h2>Remediation</h2>

<p>Upgrade <code>tar</code> to version 3.2.2, 4.4.14, 5.0.6, 6.1.1 or higher.</p>

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/tar" rel="nofollow">tar</a> is a full-featured Tar for Node.js.</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Overwrite. This is due to insufficient symlink protection.
<code>node-tar</code> aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks.  Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary <code>stat</code> calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created.</p>

<p>This logic is insufficient when extracting tar files that contain both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations results in the directory being created and added to the <code>node-tar</code> directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to <code>mkdir</code> for that directory are skipped.
However, this is also where <code>node-tar</code> checks for symlinks occur. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it is possible to bypass <code>node-tar</code> symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location.</p>

<h2>Remediation</h2>

<p>Upgrade <code>tar</code> to version 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7, 6.1.2 or higher.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>

<p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren’t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>

<p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>

<pre><code>regex = /A(B|C+)+D/
</code></pre>

<p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:
- <code>A</code> The string must start with the letter ‘A’
- <code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter ‘B’ or some number of occurrences of the letter ‘C’ (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
- <code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a ’D’</p>

<p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>

<p>It most cases, it doesn’t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>

<pre><code>$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&#34;)&#39;
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&#34;)&#39;
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total
</code></pre>

<p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>

<p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: “ACCCX”. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C’s:
1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.</p>

<p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger" rel="nofollow">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn’t match.</p>

<p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>

<p>By the time the string includes 14 C’s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid.

					<h3>Prototype Pollution</h3>
					
					<p>Severity: <span id="HIGH">HIGH</span></p>
					 
						<p>EPSS: <span>84%</span></p>
					
					<p><a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-LOADERUTILS-3043105">Reference Documentation</a></p>
					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution in <code>parseQuery</code> function via the name variable in <code>parseQuery.js</code>. This pollutes the prototype of the object returned by <code>parseQuery</code> and not the global Object prototype (which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution). Therefore, the actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Prototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as <code>__proto__</code>, <code>constructor</code> and <code>prototype</code>. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the <code>Object.prototype</code> are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.</p>

<p>There are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Unsafe <code>Object</code> recursive merge</p></li>

<li><p>Property definition by path</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Unsafe Object recursive merge</h3>

<p>The logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:</p>

<pre><code>merge (target, source)

  foreach property of source

    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source

      merge(target[property], source[property])

    else

      target[property] = source[property]
</code></pre>

<p><br></p>

<p>When the source object contains a property named <code>__proto__</code> defined with <code>Object.defineProperty()</code> , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of <code>Object</code> and the source of <code>Object</code> as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the <code>Object</code> prototype.</p>

<p>Clone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: <code>merge({},source)</code>.</p>

<p><code>lodash</code> and <code>Hoek</code> are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.</p>

<h3>Property definition by path</h3>

<p>There are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: <code>theFunction(object, path, value)</code></p>

<p>If the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to <code>__proto__.myValue</code>. <code>myValue</code> is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.</p>

<h2>Types of attacks</h2>

<p>There are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Origin</th>
<th>Short description</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Denial of service (DoS)</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
<td>This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when <code>Object</code> holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, <code>toString</code> and <code>valueOf</code>). <br> The attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.someattr</code> and alters its state to an unexpected value such as <code>Int</code> or <code>Object</code>. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br><strong>For example:</strong> if an attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.toString</code> by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on <code>someobject.toString()</code> it would fail.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td><strong>Remote Code Execution</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Property Injection</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
<td>The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.<br>  <strong>For example:</strong> if a codebase checks privileges for <code>someuser.isAdmin</code>, then when the attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.isAdmin</code> and sets it to equal <code>true</code>, they can then achieve admin privileges.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Affected environments</h2>

<p>The following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Application server</p></li>

<li><p>Web server</p></li>

<li><p>Web browser</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>How to prevent</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Freeze the prototype— use <code>Object.freeze (Object.prototype)</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>Require schema validation of JSON input.</p></li>

<li><p>Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.</p></li>

<li><p>Consider using objects without prototypes (for example, <code>Object.create(null)</code>), breaking the prototype chain and preventing pollution.</p></li>

<li><p>As a best practice use <code>Map</code> instead of <code>Object</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via the <code>parse</code> method , which does not restrict parsing of keys named <code>__proto__</code>, allowing specially crafted strings to pollute the prototype of the resulting object. This pollutes the prototype of the object returned by <code>JSON5.parse</code> and not the global Object prototype (which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution). Therefore, the actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Prototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as <code>__proto__</code>, <code>constructor</code> and <code>prototype</code>. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the <code>Object.prototype</code> are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.</p>

<p>There are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Unsafe <code>Object</code> recursive merge</p></li>

<li><p>Property definition by path</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Unsafe Object recursive merge</h3>

<p>The logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:</p>

<pre><code>merge (target, source)

  foreach property of source

    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source

      merge(target[property], source[property])

    else

      target[property] = source[property]
</code></pre>

<p><br></p>

<p>When the source object contains a property named <code>__proto__</code> defined with <code>Object.defineProperty()</code> , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of <code>Object</code> and the source of <code>Object</code> as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the <code>Object</code> prototype.</p>

<p>Clone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: <code>merge({},source)</code>.</p>

<p><code>lodash</code> and <code>Hoek</code> are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.</p>

<h3>Property definition by path</h3>

<p>There are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: <code>theFunction(object, path, value)</code></p>

<p>If the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to <code>__proto__.myValue</code>. <code>myValue</code> is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.</p>

<h2>Types of attacks</h2>

<p>There are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Origin</th>
<th>Short description</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Denial of service (DoS)</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
<td>This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when <code>Object</code> holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, <code>toString</code> and <code>valueOf</code>). <br> The attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.someattr</code> and alters its state to an unexpected value such as <code>Int</code> or <code>Object</code>. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br><strong>For example:</strong> if an attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.toString</code> by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on <code>someobject.toString()</code> it would fail.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td><strong>Remote Code Execution</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Property Injection</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
<td>The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.<br>  <strong>For example:</strong> if a codebase checks privileges for <code>someuser.isAdmin</code>, then when the attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.isAdmin</code> and sets it to equal <code>true</code>, they can then achieve admin privileges.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Affected environments</h2>

<p>The following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Application server</p></li>

<li><p>Web server</p></li>

<li><p>Web browser</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>How to prevent</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Freeze the prototype— use <code>Object.freeze (Object.prototype)</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>Require schema validation of JSON input.</p></li>

<li><p>Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.</p></li>

<li><p>Consider using objects without prototypes (for example, <code>Object.create(null)</code>), breaking the prototype chain and preventing pollution.</p></li>

<li><p>As a best practice use <code>Map</code> instead of <code>Object</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs when using plugins that rely on the <code>path.evaluate()</code> or <code>path.evaluateTruthy()</code> internal Babel methods.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<p>This is only exploitable if the attacker uses known affected plugins such as <code>@babel/plugin-transform-runtime</code>, <code>@babel/preset-env</code> when using its <code>useBuiltIns</code> option, and any “polyfill provider” plugin that depends on <code>@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider</code>. No other plugins under the <code>@babel/</code> namespace are impacted, but third-party plugins might be.</p>

<p>*Users that only compile trusted code are <strong>not</strong> impacted.*</p>

<h2>Workaround</h2>

<p>Users who are unable to upgrade the library can upgrade the affected plugins instead, to avoid triggering the vulnerable code path in affected <code>@babel/traverse</code>.</p>

<h2>Remediation</h2>

<p>Upgrade <code>@babel/traverse</code> to version 7.23.2, 8.0.0-alpha.4 or higher.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>

<p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren’t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>

<p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>

<pre><code>regex = /A(B|C+)+D/
</code></pre>

<p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:
- <code>A</code> The string must start with the letter ‘A’
- <code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter ‘B’ or some number of occurrences of the letter ‘C’ (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
- <code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a ’D’</p>

<p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>

<p>It most cases, it doesn’t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>

<pre><code>$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&#34;)&#39;
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&#34;)&#39;
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total
</code></pre>

<p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>

<p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: “ACCCX”. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C’s:
1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.</p>

<p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger" rel="nofollow">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn’t match.</p>

<p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>String</th>
<th align="right">Number of C’s</th>
<th align="right">Number of steps</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ACCCX</td>
<td align="right">3</td>
<td align="right">38</td>

<td align="right">136</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX</td>
<td align="right">14</td>
<td align="right">65,553</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>By the time the string includes 14 C’s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via the <code>parse</code> method , which does not restrict parsing of keys named <code>__proto__</code>, allowing specially crafted strings to pollute the prototype of the resulting object. This pollutes the prototype of the object returned by <code>JSON5.parse</code> and not the global Object prototype (which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution). Therefore, the actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Prototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as <code>__proto__</code>, <code>constructor</code> and <code>prototype</code>. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the <code>Object.prototype</code> are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.</p>

<p>There are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Unsafe <code>Object</code> recursive merge</p></li>

<li><p>Property definition by path</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Unsafe Object recursive merge</h3>

<p>The logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:</p>

<pre><code>merge (target, source)

  foreach property of source

    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source

      merge(target[property], source[property])

    else

      target[property] = source[property]
</code></pre>

<p><br></p>

<p>When the source object contains a property named <code>__proto__</code> defined with <code>Object.defineProperty()</code> , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of <code>Object</code> and the source of <code>Object</code> as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the <code>Object</code> prototype.</p>

<p>Clone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: <code>merge({},source)</code>.</p>

<p><code>lodash</code> and <code>Hoek</code> are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.</p>

<h3>Property definition by path</h3>

<p>There are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: <code>theFunction(object, path, value)</code></p>

<p>If the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to <code>__proto__.myValue</code>. <code>myValue</code> is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.</p>

<h2>Types of attacks</h2>

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in <code>interpolateName</code> function via the <code>URL</code> variable.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>

<p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren’t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>

<p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>

<pre><code>regex = /A(B|C+)+D/
</code></pre>

<p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:
- <code>A</code> The string must start with the letter ‘A’
- <code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter ‘B’ or some number of occurrences of the letter ‘C’ (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
- <code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a ’D’</p>

<p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>

<p>It most cases, it doesn’t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>

<pre><code>$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&#34;)&#39;
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&#34;)&#39;
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total
</code></pre>

<p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>

<p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one.

					<h3>Prototype Pollution</h3>
					
					<p>Severity: <span id="HIGH">HIGH</span></p>
					 
						<p>EPSS: <span>84%</span></p>
					
					<p><a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-LOADERUTILS-3043105">Reference Documentation</a></p>
					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution in <code>parseQuery</code> function via the name variable in <code>parseQuery.js</code>. This pollutes the prototype of the object returned by <code>parseQuery</code> and not the global Object prototype (which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution). Therefore, the actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Prototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as <code>__proto__</code>, <code>constructor</code> and <code>prototype</code>. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the <code>Object.prototype</code> are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.</p>

<p>There are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Unsafe <code>Object</code> recursive merge</p></li>

<li><p>Property definition by path</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Unsafe Object recursive merge</h3>

<p>The logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:</p>

<pre><code>merge (target, source)

  foreach property of source

    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source

      merge(target[property], source[property])

    else

      target[property] = source[property]
</code></pre>

<p><br></p>

<p>When the source object contains a property named <code>__proto__</code> defined with <code>Object.defineProperty()</code> , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of <code>Object</code> and the source of <code>Object</code> as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the <code>Object</code> prototype.</p>

<p>Clone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: <code>merge({},source)</code>.</p>

<p><code>lodash</code> and <code>Hoek</code> are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.</p>

<h3>Property definition by path</h3>

<p>There are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: <code>theFunction(object, path, value)</code></p>

<p>If the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to <code>__proto__.myValue</code>. <code>myValue</code> is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.</p>

<h2>Types of attacks</h2>

<p>There are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Origin</th>
<th>Short description</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Denial of service (DoS)</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
<td>This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when <code>Object</code> holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, <code>toString</code> and <code>valueOf</code>). <br> The attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.someattr</code> and alters its state to an unexpected value such as <code>Int</code> or <code>Object</code>. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br><strong>For example:</strong> if an attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.toString</code> by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on <code>someobject.toString()</code> it would fail.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td><strong>Remote Code Execution</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Property Injection</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
<td>The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.<br>  <strong>For example:</strong> if a codebase checks privileges for <code>someuser.isAdmin</code>, then when the attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.isAdmin</code> and sets it to equal <code>true</code>, they can then achieve admin privileges.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Affected environments</h2>

<p>The following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Application server</p></li>

<li><p>Web server</p></li>

<li><p>Web browser</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>How to prevent</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Freeze the prototype— use <code>Object.freeze (Object.prototype)</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>Require schema validation of JSON input.</p></li>

<li><p>Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.</p></li>

<li><p>Consider using objects without prototypes (for example, <code>Object.create(null)</code>), breaking the prototype chain and preventing pollution.</p></li>

<li><p>As a best practice use <code>Map</code> instead of <code>Object</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&#34;)&#39;
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total
</code></pre>

<p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>

<p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: “ACCCX”. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C’s:
1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.</p>

<p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger" rel="nofollow">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn’t match.</p>

<p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>

<p>By the time the string includes 14 C’s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

<p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one.

<p>Let’s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: “ACCCX”. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C’s:
1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.</p>

<p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression.

					<p><a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SERIALIZEJAVASCRIPT-6147607">Reference Documentation</a></p>
					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/serialize-javascript" rel="nofollow">serialize-javascript</a> is a package to serialize JavaScript to a superset of JSON that includes regular expressions and functions.</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) due to unsanitized URLs. An Attacker can introduce unsafe <code>HTML</code> characters through non-http <code>URLs</code>.</p>

<h2>PoC</h2>

<pre><code>const serialize = require(&#39;serialize-javascript&#39;);

let x = serialize({
    x: new URL(&#34;x:&lt;/script&gt;&#34;)
});

console.log(x)
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>A cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.</p>

<p>This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.</p>

<p>Injecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.</p>

<p>Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, <code>&lt;</code> can be coded as  <code>&amp;lt</code>; and <code>&gt;</code> can be coded as <code>&amp;gt</code>; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.</p>

<p>The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware.</p>

<h3>Types of attacks</h3>

<p>There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Origin</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Stored</strong></td>
<td>Server</td>
<td>The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Reflected</strong></td>
<td>Server</td>
<td>The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>DOM-based</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
<td>The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Mutated</strong></td>
<td></td>
<td>The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Affected environments</h3>

<p>The following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:</p>

<ul>
<li>Web servers</li>
<li>Application servers</li>
<li>Web application environments</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to prevent</h3>

<p>This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches.</li>
<li>Convert special characters such as <code>?</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code> and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.</li>
<li>Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.</li>
<li>Redirect invalid requests.</li>
<li>Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.</li>
<li>Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.</li>
<li>Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>

<p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren’t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>

<p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>

<pre><code>regex = /A(B|C+)+D/
</code></pre>

<p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:
- <code>A</code> The string must start with the letter ‘A’
- <code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter ‘B’ or some number of occurrences of the letter ‘C’ (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
- <code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a ’D’</p>

<p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>

<p>It most cases, it doesn’t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>

<pre><code>$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&#34;)&#39;
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&#34;)&#39;
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total
</code></pre>

<p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>

<p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: “ACCCX”. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C’s:
1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.</p>

<p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger" rel="nofollow">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn’t match.</p>

<p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>

<p>By the time the string includes 14 C’s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/object-path" rel="nofollow">object-path</a> is a package to access deep properties using a path</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. A prototype pollution vulnerability exists in <code>del()</code>, <code>empty()</code>, <code>push()</code>, <code>insert()</code> functions when using the “inherited props” mode (e.g. when a new <code>object-path</code> instance is created with the <code>includeInheritedProps</code> option set to <code>true</code>, or when using the <code>withInheritedProps</code> default instance).</p>

<p>To help with preventing this type of vulnerability in the client code, also the <code>get()</code> function will now throw an exception if an object’s magic properties are accessed. The vulnerability does not exist in the default instance exposed by object path (e.g <code>objectPath.del()</code>) if using version &gt;= <code>0.11.0</code>.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Prototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as <code>__proto__</code>, <code>constructor</code> and <code>prototype</code>. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the <code>Object.prototype</code> are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.</p>

<p>There are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Unsafe <code>Object</code> recursive merge</p></li>

<li><p>Property definition by path</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Unsafe Object recursive merge</h3>

<p>The logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:</p>

<pre><code>merge (target, source)

  foreach property of source

    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source

      merge(target[property], source[property])

    else

      target[property] = source[property]
</code></pre>

<p><br></p>

<p>When the source object contains a property named <code>__proto__</code> defined with <code>Object.defineProperty()</code> , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of <code>Object</code> and the source of <code>Object</code> as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the <code>Object</code> prototype.</p>

<p>Clone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: <code>merge({},source)</code>.</p>

<p><code>lodash</code> and <code>Hoek</code> are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.</p>

<h3>Property definition by path</h3>

<p>There are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: <code>theFunction(object, path, value)</code></p>

<p>If the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to <code>__proto__.myValue</code>. <code>myValue</code> is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.</p>

					<h3>Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)</h3>
					
					<p>Severity: <span id="MODERATE">MODERATE</span></p>
					 
						<p>EPSS: <span>70%</span></p>
					
					<p><a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-LOADERUTILS-3042992">Reference Documentation</a></p>
					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the <code>resourcePath</code> variable in <code>interpolateName.js</code>.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>

<p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren’t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>

<p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>

<pre><code>regex = /A(B|C+)+D/
</code></pre>

<p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:
- <code>A</code> The string must start with the letter ‘A’
- <code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter ‘B’ or some number of occurrences of the letter ‘C’ (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
- <code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a ’D’</p>

<p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>

<p>It most cases, it doesn’t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>

<pre><code>$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&#34;)&#39;
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&#34;)&#39;
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total
</code></pre>

<p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>

<p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: “ACCCX”. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C’s:
1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.</p>

<p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger" rel="nofollow">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn’t match.</p>

<p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>String</th>
<th align="right">Number of C’s</th>
<th align="right">Number of steps</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ACCCX</td>
<td align="right">3</td>
<td align="right">38</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCX</td>
<td align="right">4</td>
<td align="right">71</td>

<tr>

<td align="right">136</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX</td>
<td align="right">14</td>
<td align="right">65,553</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>By the time the string includes 14 C’s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>

<p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren’t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>

<p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>

<pre><code>regex = /A(B|C+)+D/
</code></pre>

<p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:
- <code>A</code> The string must start with the letter ‘A’
- <code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter ‘B’ or some number of occurrences of the letter ‘C’ (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
- <code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a ’D’</p>

<p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>

<p>It most cases, it doesn’t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>

<pre><code>$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&#34;)&#39;
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&#34;)&#39;
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total
</code></pre>

<p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>

<p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: “ACCCX”. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C’s:
1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.</p>

<p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger" rel="nofollow">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn’t match.</p>

<p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>

					<h3>Prototype Pollution</h3>
					
					<p>Severity: <span id="HIGH">HIGH</span></p>
					 
						<p>EPSS: <span>84%</span></p>
					
					<p><a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-LOADERUTILS-3043105">Reference Documentation</a></p>
					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution in <code>parseQuery</code> function via the name variable in <code>parseQuery.js</code>. This pollutes the prototype of the object returned by <code>parseQuery</code> and not the global Object prototype (which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution). Therefore, the actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Prototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as <code>__proto__</code>, <code>constructor</code> and <code>prototype</code>. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the <code>Object.prototype</code> are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.</p>

<p>There are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Unsafe <code>Object</code> recursive merge</p></li>

<li><p>Property definition by path</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Unsafe Object recursive merge</h3>

<p>The logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:</p>

<pre><code>merge (target, source)

  foreach property of source

    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source

      merge(target[property], source[property])

    else

      target[property] = source[property]
</code></pre>

<p><br></p>

<p>When the source object contains a property named <code>__proto__</code> defined with <code>Object.defineProperty()</code> , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of <code>Object</code> and the source of <code>Object</code> as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the <code>Object</code> prototype.</p>

<p>Clone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: <code>merge({},source)</code>.</p>

<p><code>lodash</code> and <code>Hoek</code> are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.</p>

<h3>Property definition by path</h3>

<p>There are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: <code>theFunction(object, path, value)</code></p>

<p>If the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to <code>__proto__.myValue</code>. <code>myValue</code> is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.</p>

<h2>Types of attacks</h2>

<p>There are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Origin</th>
<th>Short description</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Denial of service (DoS)</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
<td>This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when <code>Object</code> holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, <code>toString</code> and <code>valueOf</code>). <br> The attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.someattr</code> and alters its state to an unexpected value such as <code>Int</code> or <code>Object</code>. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br><strong>For example:</strong> if an attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.toString</code> by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on <code>someobject.toString()</code> it would fail.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td><strong>Remote Code Execution</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Property Injection</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
<td>The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.<br>  <strong>For example:</strong> if a codebase checks privileges for <code>someuser.isAdmin</code>, then when the attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.isAdmin</code> and sets it to equal <code>true</code>, they can then achieve admin privileges.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Affected environments</h2>

<p>The following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Application server</p></li>

<li><p>Web server</p></li>

<li><p>Web browser</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>How to prevent</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Freeze the prototype— use <code>Object.freeze (Object.prototype)</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>Require schema validation of JSON input.</p></li>

<li><p>Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.</p></li>

<li><p>Consider using objects without prototypes (for example, <code>Object.create(null)</code>), breaking the prototype chain and preventing pollution.</p></li>

<li><p>As a best practice use <code>Map</code> instead of <code>Object</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>

<p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren’t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>

<p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>

<pre><code>regex = /A(B|C+)+D/
</code></pre>

<p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:
- <code>A</code> The string must start with the letter ‘A’
- <code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter ‘B’ or some number of occurrences of the letter ‘C’ (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
- <code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a ’D’</p>

<p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>

<p>It most cases, it doesn’t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>

<pre><code>$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&#34;)&#39;
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&#34;)&#39;
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total
</code></pre>

<p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>

<p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: “ACCCX”. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C’s:
1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.</p>

<p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger" rel="nofollow">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn’t match.</p>

<p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>

					<p><a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SERIALIZEJAVASCRIPT-6147607">Reference Documentation</a></p>
					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/serialize-javascript" rel="nofollow">serialize-javascript</a> is a package to serialize JavaScript to a superset of JSON that includes regular expressions and functions.</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) due to unsanitized URLs. An Attacker can introduce unsafe <code>HTML</code> characters through non-http <code>URLs</code>.</p>

<h2>PoC</h2>

<pre><code>const serialize = require(&#39;serialize-javascript&#39;);

let x = serialize({
    x: new URL(&#34;x:&lt;/script&gt;&#34;)
});

console.log(x)
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>A cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.</p>

<p>This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.</p>

<p>Injecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.</p>

<p>Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, <code>&lt;</code> can be coded as  <code>&amp;lt</code>; and <code>&gt;</code> can be coded as <code>&amp;gt</code>; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.</p>

<p>The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware.</p>

<h3>Types of attacks</h3>

<p>There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Origin</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Stored</strong></td>
<td>Server</td>
<td>The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Reflected</strong></td>
<td>Server</td>
<td>The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>DOM-based</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
<td>The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Mutated</strong></td>
<td></td>
<td>The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Affected environments</h3>

<p>The following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:</p>

<ul>
<li>Web servers</li>
<li>Application servers</li>
<li>Web application environments</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to prevent</h3>

<p>This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches.</li>
<li>Convert special characters such as <code>?</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code> and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.</li>
<li>Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.</li>
<li>Redirect invalid requests.</li>
<li>Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.</li>
<li>Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.</li>
<li>Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.</li>
</ul>

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob-parent" rel="nofollow">glob-parent</a> is a package that helps extracting the non-magic parent path from a glob string.</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). The <code>enclosure</code> regex used to check for strings ending in enclosure containing path separator.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>

<p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren’t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>

<p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>

<pre><code>regex = /A(B|C+)+D/
</code></pre>

<p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:
- <code>A</code> The string must start with the letter ‘A’
- <code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter ‘B’ or some number of occurrences of the letter ‘C’ (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
- <code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a ’D’</p>

<p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>

<p>It most cases, it doesn’t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>

<pre><code>$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&#34;)&#39;
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&#34;)&#39;
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total
</code></pre>

<p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>

<p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: “ACCCX”. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C’s:
1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.</p>

<p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger" rel="nofollow">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn’t match.</p>

<p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>String</th>
<th align="right">Number of C’s</th>
<th align="right">Number of steps</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ACCCX</td>
<td align="right">3</td>
<td align="right">38</td>

<td align="right">136</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX</td>
<td align="right">14</td>
<td align="right">65,553</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>By the time the string includes 14 C’s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) via DOM clobbering in the <code>AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule</code> class. Non-script HTML elements with unsanitized attributes such as <code>name</code> and <code>id</code> can be leveraged to execute code in the victim’s browser. An attacker who can control such elements on a page that includes Webpack-generated files, can cause subsequent scripts to be loaded from a malicious domain.</p>

<h2>PoC</h2>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Webpack Example&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element starts--!&gt;
  &lt;img name=&#34;currentScript&#34; src=&#34;https://attacker.controlled.server/&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
  &lt;!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element ends--!&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;./dist/webpack-gadgets.bundle.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>A cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.</p>

<p>This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.</p>

<p>Injecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.</p>

<p>Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, <code>&lt;</code> can be coded as  <code>&amp;lt</code>; and <code>&gt;</code> can be coded as <code>&amp;gt</code>; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.</p>

<p>The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware.</p>

<h3>Types of attacks</h3>

<p>There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Origin</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Stored</strong></td>
<td>Server</td>
<td>The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Reflected</strong></td>
<td>Server</td>
<td>The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>DOM-based</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
<td>The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Mutated</strong></td>
<td></td>
<td>The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Affected environments</h3>

<p>The following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:</p>

<ul>
<li>Web servers</li>
<li>Application servers</li>
<li>Web application environments</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to prevent</h3>

<p>This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches.</li>
<li>Convert special characters such as <code>?</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code> and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.</li>
<li>Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.</li>
<li>Redirect invalid requests.</li>
<li>Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.</li>
<li>Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.</li>
<li>Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.</li>
</ul>

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Path Traversal due to insufficient validation of the supplied URL address before returning the local file. This issue allows accessing any file on the developer’s machine. The middleware can operate with either the physical filesystem or a virtualized in-memory <code>memfs</code> filesystem. When the <code>writeToDisk</code> configuration option is set to <code>true</code>, the physical filesystem is utilized. The <code>getFilenameFromUrl</code> method parses the URL and constructs the local file path by stripping the public path prefix from the URL and appending the <code>unescaped</code> path suffix to the <code>outputPath</code>. Since the URL is not unescaped and normalized automatically before calling the middleware, it is possible to use <code>%2e</code> and <code>%2f</code> sequences to perform a path traversal attack.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>This vulnerability is exploitable without any specific configurations, allowing an attacker to access and exfiltrate content from any file on the developer’s machine.</p></li>

<li><p>If the development server is exposed on a public IP address or <code>0.0.0.0</code>, an attacker on the local network can access the files without victim interaction.</p></li>

<li><p>If the server permits access from third-party domains, a malicious link could lead to local file exfiltration when visited by the victim.</p>

<h2>PoC</h2>

<p>A blank project can be created containing the following configuration file webpack.config.js:</p></li>
</ol>

<p><code>module.exports = { devServer: { devMiddleware: { writeToDisk: true } } };</code></p>

<p>When started, it is possible to access any local file, e.g. /etc/passwd:</p>

<p><code>$ curl localhost:8080/public/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f../etc/passwd</code></p>

<pre><code>root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/pillarjs/send" rel="nofollow">send</a> is a Better streaming static file server with Range and conditional-GET support</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting due to improper user input sanitization passed to the <code>SendStream.redirect()</code> function, which executes untrusted code. An attacker can execute arbitrary code by manipulating the input parameters to this method.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<p>Exploiting this vulnerability requires the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The attacker needs to control the input to <code>response.redirect()</code></p></li>

<li><p>Express MUST NOT redirect before the template appears</p></li>

<li><p>The browser MUST NOT complete redirection before</p></li>

<li><p>The user MUST click on the link in the template</p>

<h2>Details</h2></li>
</ol>

<p>A cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.</p>

<p>This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.</p>

<p>Injecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.</p>

<p>Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, <code>&lt;</code> can be coded as  <code>&amp;lt</code>; and <code>&gt;</code> can be coded as <code>&amp;gt</code>; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.</p>

<p>The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware.</p>

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Handling of Extra Parameters due to the improper handling of URLs by the <code>url.parse()</code> function. When <code>new URL()</code> throws an error, it can be manipulated to misinterpret the hostname. An attacker could exploit this weakness to redirect traffic to a malicious site, potentially leading to information disclosure, phishing attacks, or other security breaches.</p>

<h2>PoC</h2>

<pre><code># Case 1 : Bypassing localhost restriction
let url = &#39;http://[localhost]/admin&#39;;
try{
    new URL(url); // ERROR : Invalid URL
}catch{
    url.parse(url); // -&gt; http://localhost/admin
}

# Case 2 : Bypassing domain restriction
let url = &#39;http://attacker.domain*.allowed.domain:a&#39;;
try{
    new URL(url); // ERROR : Invalid URL
}catch{
    url.parse(url); // -&gt; http://attacker.domain/*.allowed.domain:a
}

					<h3>Prototype Pollution</h3>
					
					<p>Severity: <span id="MODERATE">MODERATE</span></p>
					
					<p><a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-NODEFORGE-2331908">Reference Documentation</a></p>
					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge" rel="nofollow">node-forge</a> is a JavaScript implementations of network transports, cryptography, ciphers, PKI, message digests, and various utilities.</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via the <code>forge.debug</code> API if called with untrusted input.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Prototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as <code>__proto__</code>, <code>constructor</code> and <code>prototype</code>. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the <code>Object.prototype</code> are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.</p>

<p>There are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Unsafe <code>Object</code> recursive merge</p></li>

<li><p>Property definition by path</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Unsafe Object recursive merge</h3>

<p>The logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:</p>

<pre><code>merge (target, source)

  foreach property of source

    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source

      merge(target[property], source[property])

    else

      target[property] = source[property]
</code></pre>

<p><br></p>

<p>When the source object contains a property named <code>__proto__</code> defined with <code>Object.defineProperty()</code> , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of <code>Object</code> and the source of <code>Object</code> as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the <code>Object</code> prototype.</p>

<p>Clone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: <code>merge({},source)</code>.</p>

<p><code>lodash</code> and <code>Hoek</code> are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.</p>

<h3>Property definition by path</h3>

<p>There are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: <code>theFunction(object, path, value)</code></p>

<p>If the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to <code>__proto__.myValue</code>. <code>myValue</code> is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.</p>

<h2>Types of attacks</h2>

<p>There are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Origin</th>
<th>Short description</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Denial of service (DoS)</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
<td>This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when <code>Object</code> holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, <code>toString</code> and <code>valueOf</code>). <br> The attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.someattr</code> and alters its state to an unexpected value such as <code>Int</code> or <code>Object</code>. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br><strong>For example:</strong> if an attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.toString</code> by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on <code>someobject.toString()</code> it would fail.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td><strong>Remote Code Execution</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Property Injection</strong></td>
<td>Client</td>
<td>The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.<br>  <strong>For example:</strong> if a codebase checks privileges for <code>someuser.isAdmin</code>, then when the attacker pollutes <code>Object.prototype.isAdmin</code> and sets it to equal <code>true</code>, they can then achieve admin privileges.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Affected environments</h2>

<p>The following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Application server</p></li>

<li><p>Web server</p></li>

<li><p>Web browser</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>How to prevent</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Freeze the prototype— use <code>Object.freeze (Object.prototype)</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>Require schema validation of JSON input.</p></li>

<li><p>Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.</p></li>

<li><p>Consider using objects without prototypes (for example, <code>Object.create(null)</code>), breaking the prototype chain and preventing pollution.</p></li>

<li><p>As a best practice use <code>Map</code> instead of <code>Object</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.</p>

<p>Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.</p>

<p>One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.</p>

<p>When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.</p>

<p>Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, <a href="SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082" rel="nofollow">commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108" rel="nofollow">npm <code>ws</code> package</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Remediation</h2>

<p>Upgrade <code>ws</code> to version 5.2.4, 6.2.3, 7.5.10, 8.17.1 or higher.</p>

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/core" rel="nofollow">@angular/core</a> is a package that lets you write client-side web applications as if you had a smarter browser. It also lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express your application’s components clearly and succinctly.</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in development, with SSR enabled.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>A cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.</p>

<p>This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.</p>

<p>Injecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.</p>

<p>Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, <code>&lt;</code> can be coded as  <code>&amp;lt</code>; and <code>&gt;</code> can be coded as <code>&amp;gt</code>; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.</p>

<p>The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware.</p>

<h3>Types of attacks</h3>

<p>There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:</p>

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/trim-newlines" rel="nofollow">trim-newlines</a> is a Trim newlines from the start and/or end of a string</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) via the <code>end()</code> method.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.</p>

<p>Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.</p>

<p>One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.</p>

<p>When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.</p>

<p>Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, <a href="https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082" rel="nofollow">commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108" rel="nofollow">npm <code>ws</code> package</a></p></li>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>

<p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren’t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>

<p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>

<pre><code>regex = /A(B|C+)+D/
</code></pre>

<p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:
- <code>A</code> The string must start with the letter ‘A’
- <code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter ‘B’ or some number of occurrences of the letter ‘C’ (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
- <code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a ’D’</p>

<p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>

<p>It most cases, it doesn’t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>

<pre><code>$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&#34;)&#39;
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&#34;)&#39;
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total
</code></pre>

<p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>

<p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: “ACCCX”. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C’s:
1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.</p>

<p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger" rel="nofollow">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn’t match.</p>

<p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>String</th>
<th align="right">Number of C’s</th>
<th align="right">Number of steps</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ACCCX</td>
<td align="right">3</td>
<td align="right">38</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCX</td>
<td align="right">4</td>
<td align="right">71</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCCX</td>
<td align="right">5</td>
<td align="right">136</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX</td>
<td align="right">14</td>
<td align="right">65,553</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>By the time the string includes 14 C’s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS). Uncontrolled recursion is possible in <code>Sass::Complex_Selector::perform</code> in <code>ast.hpp</code> and <code>Sass::Inspect::operator</code> in <code>inspect.cpp</code>. Note: <code>node-sass</code> is affected by this vulnerability due to its bundled usage of the <code>libsass</code> package.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>A cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.</p>

<p>This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.</p>

<p>Injecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.</p>

<p>Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, <code>&lt;</code> can be coded as  <code>&amp;lt</code>; and <code>&gt;</code> can be coded as <code>&amp;gt</code>; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.</p>

<p>The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware.</p>

					<p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://npmjs.org/package/node-sass" rel="nofollow">node-sass</a> is a Node.js bindings package for libsass.</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Out-of-bounds Read via <code>Sass::weaveParents</code> in <code>ast_sel_weave.cpp</code>. Note: <code>node-sass</code> is affected by this vulnerability due to its bundled usage of the <code>libsass</code> package.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.</p>

<p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren’t very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.</p>

<p>Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:</p>

<pre><code>regex = /A(B|C+)+D/
</code></pre>

<p>This regular expression accomplishes the following:
- <code>A</code> The string must start with the letter ‘A’
- <code>(B|C+)+</code> The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter ‘B’ or some number of occurrences of the letter ‘C’ (the <code>+</code> matches one or more times). The <code>+</code> at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
- <code>D</code> Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a ’D’</p>

<p>The expression would match inputs such as <code>ABBD</code>, <code>ABCCCCD</code>, <code>ABCBCCCD</code> and <code>ACCCCCD</code></p>

<p>It most cases, it doesn’t take very long for a regex engine to find a match:</p>

<pre><code>$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD&#34;)&#39;
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e &#39;/A(B|C+)+D/.test(&#34;ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX&#34;)&#39;
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total
</code></pre>

<p>The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.</p>

<p>Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: “ACCCX”. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C’s:
1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.</p>

<p>The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use <a href="https://regex101.com/debugger" rel="nofollow">RegEx 101 debugger</a> to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn’t match.</p>

<p>From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>String</th>
<th align="right">Number of C’s</th>
<th align="right">Number of steps</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ACCCX</td>
<td align="right">3</td>
<td align="right">38</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCX</td>
<td align="right">4</td>
<td align="right">71</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCCX</td>
<td align="right">5</td>
<td align="right">136</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX</td>
<td align="right">14</td>
<td align="right">65,553</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>By the time the string includes 14 C’s, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>

<p><a href="https://npmjs.org/package/node-sass" rel="nofollow">node-sass</a> is a Node.js bindings package for libsass.</p>

<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Use After Free via the <code>SharedPtr</code> class in <code>SharedPtr.cpp</code> (or <code>SharedPtr.hpp</code>) that may cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact. Note: <code>node-sass</code> is affected by this vulnerability due to its bundled usage of the <code>libsass</code> package.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>A cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.</p>

<p>This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.</p>

<p>Injecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.</p>

<p>Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, <code>&lt;</code> can be coded as  <code>&amp;lt</code>; and <code>&gt;</code> can be coded as <code>&amp;gt</code>; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.</p>

<p>The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware.</p>

<h3>Types of attacks</h3>
